## Silk profiler

### Silk profiler use case

Silk Profiler is a performance profiling tool that can be used to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the performance of Python code. Here are some use cases where Silk Profiler can be useful:

* Identifying performance bottlenecks: Silk Profiler can help developers identify performance bottlenecks in their code by showing which parts of the code are taking the most time to execute.

* Optimizing code performance: Once performance bottlenecks are identified, Silk Profiler can help developers optimize the code by providing information on how to make the code run faster.

* Debugging code: Silk Profiler can be used to identify errors in code that may be causing slow performance. It can help developers pinpoint the exact location of the error, making it easier to fix.

* Tuning code for specific hardware: Silk Profiler can be used to optimize code for specific hardware configurations, such as multi-core processors or GPUs, by showing how the code is utilizing hardware resources.

Overall, Silk Profiler is a useful tool for any developer looking to optimize the performance of their Python code, whether they are developing for web applications, scientific computing, or machine learning.

### Instaling process:
    pip install django-silk ==4.4.1

Add the following to your settings.py:

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    ...
    'silk.middleware.SilkyMiddleware',
    ...
    )

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'silk'
    )

    # Add the following line of code to enable profiling:
    SILKY_PYTHON_PROFILER = True

Add the following to your urls.py:

    urlpatterns += patterns('', url(r'^silk', include('silk.urls', namespace='silk')))


### How to use silk profiler:

Firstly import silk profiler

    from silk.profiling.profiler import silk_profile

write this decorator above the method/fucntion @silk_profile(name='Any name')

Examples:

    @silk_profile(name='View Blog Post')
    def post(request, post_id):
        p = Post.objects.get(pk=post_id)
        return render_to_response('post.html', {
            'post': p
        })

    class MyView(View):
        @silk_profile(name='View Blog Post')
        def get(self, request):
                p = Post.objects.get(pk=post_id)
            return render_to_response('post.html', {
                    'post': p
            })

Now,

Run your code: Run your code as you normally would. As your code runs, Silk Profiler will collect performance data.

Access the Silk Profiler dashboard: After your code has finished running, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000/silk/. This will take you to the Silk Profiler dashboard.

Analyze the data: The Silk Profiler dashboard will show you detailed performance data for your code, including the total time it took to run, which parts of your code took the most time to execute, and how much time was spent in each function. You can use this data to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your code.
