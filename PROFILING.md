# Profiling

## Silk profiler

### Silk profiler use case

Silk Profiler is a performance profiling tool that can be used to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize the performance of Python code. Here are some use cases where Silk Profiler can be useful:

* Identifying performance bottlenecks: Silk Profiler can help developers identify performance bottlenecks in their code by showing which parts of the code are taking the most time to execute.

* Optimizing code performance: Once performance bottlenecks are identified, Silk Profiler can help developers optimize the code by providing information on how to make the code run faster.

* Debugging code: Silk Profiler can be used to identify errors in code that may be causing slow performance. It can help developers pinpoint the exact location of the error, making it easier to fix.

* Tuning code for specific hardware: Silk Profiler can be used to optimize code for specific hardware configurations, such as multi-core processors or GPUs, by showing how the code is utilizing hardware resources.

Overall, Silk Profiler is a useful tool for any developer looking to optimize the performance of their Python code, whether they are developing for web applications, scientific computing, or machine learning.

### Instaling process:
    pip install django-silk ==4.4.1

Add the following to your settings.py:

    MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
    ...
    'silk.middleware.SilkyMiddleware',
    ...
    )

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'silk'
    )

    # Add the following line of code to enable profiling:
    SILKY_PYTHON_PROFILER = True

Add the following to your urls.py:

    urlpatterns += patterns('', url(r'^silk', include('silk.urls', namespace='silk')))


### How to use silk profiler:

Firstly import silk profiler

    from silk.profiling.profiler import silk_profile

write this decorator above the method/fucntion @silk_profile(name='Any name')

Examples:

    @silk_profile(name='View Blog Post')
    def post(request, post_id):
        p = Post.objects.get(pk=post_id)
        return render_to_response('post.html', {
            'post': p
        })

    class MyView(View):
        @silk_profile(name='View Blog Post')
        def get(self, request):
                p = Post.objects.get(pk=post_id)
            return render_to_response('post.html', {
                    'post': p
            })

Now,

Run your code: Run your code as you normally would. As your code runs, Silk Profiler will collect performance data.

Access the Silk Profiler dashboard: After your code has finished running, open your web browser and go to http://localhost:8000/silk/. This will take you to the Silk Profiler dashboard.

Analyze the data: The Silk Profiler dashboard will show you detailed performance data for your code, including the total time it took to run, which parts of your code took the most time to execute, and how much time was spent in each function. You can use this data to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize your code.


## Memory profiler

### Memory profiler use case

Memory profiling is a technique used to measure the memory usage of an application or a program. It helps identify memory leaks, inefficient memory usage, and other memory-related issues in the application. Memory profiler tools are used by developers to optimize the memory usage of their applications and to ensure that they are running efficiently.

There are several use cases for memory profiling, including:

* Identifying memory leaks: Memory leaks occur when an application does not release memory that is no longer needed. Memory profiler tools can help identify the source of the leak so that developers can fix it.

* Analyzing memory usage: Memory profiler tools can provide detailed information about how an application is using memory. This information can help developers optimize memory usage and identify potential bottlenecks.

* Debugging performance issues: Memory profiler tools can help identify performance issues caused by inefficient memory usage. By analyzing memory usage patterns, developers can optimize their code to improve performance.

* Testing and optimization: Memory profiler tools can be used to test and optimize an application's memory usage during development. This can help ensure that the application runs efficiently and that it can handle large datasets and user loads.

Overall, memory profiling is an essential tool for developers who want to ensure that their applications are running efficiently and effectively. By identifying memory-related issues and optimizing memory usage, developers can create high-performing applications that deliver a great user experience.

### Instaling process:

Install memory-profiler using pip:

    pip install memory-profiler

### How to use memory profiler:

Decorate the function or script that you want to profile with the @profile decorator from the memory_profiler package. For example:

    from memory_profiler import profile

    @profile
    def my_function():
        # function code here


To store memory profiler output in a file:

    from django.conf import settings
    import os

    fp=open(os.path.join(settings.API_LOG_ROOT, "roster_django_application_"+settings.ENVIRONMENT+".log"),'w+')
    @profile(stream=fp)
    def my_function():
        # function code here
